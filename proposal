# PixelBeats: A Music-Driven Pixel Art Visualizer

## https://github.com/your-username/pixelbeats-visualizer

## PixelBeats is a real-time pixel art visualizer that reacts to music/audio input, creating procedurally generated visual patterns and animations. It blends generative art and music, perfect for visual performance artists, VJs, and digital art installations.

## Features
- **Audio Input Processing**
  - Uses Python's `pyaudio` or `sounddevice` to process real-time audio input.
- **Pixel Art Generator**
  - Generate retro-style pixel visuals that react to audio frequency/amplitude using `PIL` and `numpy`.
- **Color & Pattern Variations**
  - Users can select color palettes and animation styles to customize the experience.
- **Export/Save Functionality**
  - Users can export screenshots or GIFs of visuals using `pillow`.

## Challenges
- Learning how to analyze audio signals (e.g., FFT, frequency bands).
- Understanding and creating real-time visual feedback loops.
- Working with performance optimization for smooth visuals.

## Outcomes
**Ideal Outcome:**
- A polished tool that listens to any music and creates responsive, beautiful pixel art visuals that can be recorded or used live.

**Minimal Viable Outcome:**
- A basic version that takes an audio file or real-time audio and generates one kind of pixel animation based on amplitude alone.

## Milestones
- **Week 1**
  1. Set up GitHub repository with basic file structure and README.
  2. Research and experiment with audio input using `pyaudio`.

- **Week 2**
  1. Implement basic pixel visual generation logic.
  2. Start connecting audio input to visual changes (e.g., amplitude to size/color).

- **Week 3**
  1. Add color palette and pattern selection.
  2. Test performance and frame rate.

- **Week 4 (Final)**
  1. Add export functionality.
  2. Final polishing, testing, and write documentation.
